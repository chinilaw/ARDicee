# ARDicee
An exercise I learned in Udemy that allows the creation of multiple red dices with random faces as well as rendering them on a plane. This also allows to refresh the existing dices to different faces. All the dices can also be removed with a single tap of a button.

# What I Learned
- Downloading 3D objects from Turbosquid and incorporating them inside Xcode
- Rendering dices on a flat surface by anchoring them on a plane
- Rotating objects to show their different side
- Incorporating touch capability to the flat surface
